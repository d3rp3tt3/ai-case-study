# Tempus AI: Using Artificial Intelligence to Improve EHR Patient Experiences

## Overview and Origin

### Name of company
[Tempus AI](https://www.tempus.com/)

### When was the company incorporated?
Tempus AI was founded in 2015 and is pre-IPO. The company's legal name is Tempus Labs, Inc.

### Who are the founders of the company?
Eric Lefkofsky is the founder. [Eric's bio on Tempus website](https://www.tempus.com/team_members/eric-lefkofsky/). He is a co-founder and Chairman of Groupon and is a founding partner of a venture capital company named [Lightbank](https://www.lightbank.com/team-portfolio/eric-lefkofsky). 

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Eric Lefkofsky has said he started the company because his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. He wanted to use data to inform patient diagnoses and treatment to improve patients' overall recovery.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Tempus has 16 investors, 5 of which are lead investors. They've raised $1.3 billion over 13 rounds of funding. They are currently a series G company and have had two rounds of debt financing. [Tempus financial data on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tempus-3/company_financials).

Tempus plans to IPO in 2024, seeking a $6.1 billion valuation to make the company public via the NASDAQ public stock exchange.

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Tempus is focused on collecting large datasets of medical diagnostics and clinical research findings to clinicians and researchers. They make this data available via web applications and API-integrations with other tools, including EHRs. 

Tempus is also working to integrate AI into their technology stack, focusing on providing analysis, pattern matching, and predictive treatment and recovery plans for patients.


### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Tempus' customers are researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and orgnaizations building EHRs.

I was unable to find definitive information about the market size for these sets of customers. That said, the target market is extensive and spans the healthcare domain.

* Universities
* Physician specialists, such as oncologists
* EHR companies, whose customers are typically private physician offices and hospitals
* Medical researchers

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Tempus provides both a set of tools and means to directly access and analyze their large aggregated dataset and direct integration to several EHRs. Their unfair advantage is compounded by their time in the industry, strong backing by investors, and rapid revenue growth in the last year (up 65%). The company's impending IPO has provided additional market and public visibility for their technology and strategic AI messaging. 

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Tempus has documented their AI approaches at a high-level on their website through case studies. AI is integrated into several of their products. [Our Technology - Tempus website](https://www.tempus.com/about-us/tempus-tech/)

* One - A clinical AI assistant leveraging generative AI and machine learning to retrieve patient information and give realtime updates on new clinical trial results.
* Pixel - Image analysis by AI, using machine learning to assist with faster and more accurate reviews of patients' diagnostic imaging, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.
* Next - Aggregation and analysis of individual patient and larger population trends and treatment plans.

In a case study posted on the Tempus website, they highlight how the John Brancaccio St. Francis Hospital and Heart Center in New York was able to use Tempus Next to glean patient health insights from large sets of data. 

> The [Tempus Next] platform is customizable, allowing the user to filter out any information they don’t need and focus on
the exact targets of their searches. It also learns from its users as time goes on, remembering the details of
previous searches to improve the customization process. As a result, referring clinicians learned to trust the
platform’s discoveries and saw it as a helpful quality initiative. [Identifying patients with Valvular Heart Disease: A partnership between St.Francis and Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/resources/content/case-studies/identifying-patients-with-valvular-heart-disease-a-partnership-between-st-francis-and-tempus/?aliId=eyJpIjoiRjVaaE5RcHNXMzk2RVExYyIsInQiOiJuU3hLOHlTY2lBNDJDbWdaV1J1RXdnPT0ifQ%253D%253D)

The Tempus Next product uses natural language processing and machine learning to anaylyze physicians' searches and  interactions in the web application. It then uses multimodal patient data and data from clinical trials and established clinical guidelines to suggests potential treatment plans for a specific patient.


## Landscape

### What field is the company in?
Tempus is a medical data and diagnostics company, primarily focused on oncology and cancer diagnosis and treatment. They provide access to large datasets and analysis for that data to clinicians and research organizations.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
In the last 10 years, the industry has begun to move toward providing better aggregation of various datasets to help inform more efficient and accurate patient treatment of conditions like cancer. MYCIN, likely the first system designed to evaluate public health data, was created at Stanford University in the laste 1970s to improve treatment for infectious diseases.[The MYCIN Experiments - Stanford University](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/feigenbaum/browse/the-mycin-experiments). It used a simple rules-based approach to identify patterns and suggest treatment. These types of models have begun to be applied in AI neural networks in the last 5 years by companies like Tempus.

A 2019 survey of over 300,000 physicians found that "89.9% of office-based physicians used an electronic health record (EHR) system." [National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey Results and Products](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nehrs/surveyproducts.htm#:~:text=91.5%25%20of%20primary%20care%20physicians,physicians%20used%20an%20EHR%20system.) - National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey - 2019 and [Public use file national weighted estimates: National Electronic Health Records Survey, 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nehrs/2019NEHRS-PUF-weighted-estimates-508.pdf).

Because EHRs are now so prevalent, integrating datasets and analysis into those systems is a large business opportunity and is well-fit for AI.

In 2019, Thomas Davenport and Ravi Kalakota and noted data collection of test results, genetic abnormalities, DNA profiles, and treatments was not the main problem preventing doctors and patients from having better diagnostics. Rather, the problem of solving how doctors and patients get access to that data and how it is correlated is critical. As more physicians adopt EHRs, it's essential they can access both data and analysis of that information through their EHRs.

> "But whether rules-based or algorithmic in nature, AI-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations are sometimes challenging to embed in clinical workflows and EHR systems. Such integration issues have probably been a greater barrier to broad implementation of AI than any inability to provide accurate and effective recommendations; and many AI-based capabilities for diagnosis and treatment from tech firms are standalone in nature or address only a single aspect of care."

### What are the other major companies in this field?
There are two types of companies investing in this field.
EHR companies, such as McKesson and Epic 
Medica data aggregators and analyzers, such as 

Here are some of the top companies in this field: 

**EHRs**
* Epic (Epic Genomics Module and Aura)
* Cerner
* CureMD
* Meditech
* NextGen
* Veradigm (formally known as, Allscripts)
* Flatiron’s OncoEMR
* iKnowMed
* McKesson

**Medical data aggregators**
* OpGen
* Genuity Science

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
 Tempus stands out in this field for several reasons. First, public information from EHR companies show they're focused more on improving claims review and acceptance rates. This is a great thing for them to solve, but it's not my area of focus for this case study.
