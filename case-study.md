### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Eric Lefkofsky has said he started the company because his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. He wanted to use data to inform patient diagnoses and treatment to improve patients' overall recovery.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Tempus has 16 investors, 5 of which are lead investors. They've raised $1.3 billion over 13 rounds of funding. They are currently a series G company and have had two rounds of debt financing.

## Business Activities

### What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?


### Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

### What field is the company in?
Tempus is a medical data and diagnostics company, primarily focused on oncology and cancer diagnosis and treatment. They provide access to large datasets and analysis for that data to clinicians and research organizations.

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
In the last 10 years, the industry has begun to move toward providing better aggregation of various datasets to help inform more efficient and accurate patient treatment of conditions like cancer. MYCIN, likely the first system designed to evaluate public health data, was created at Stanford University in the laste 1970s to improve treatment for infectious diseases.[The MYCIN Experiments - Stanford University](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/feigenbaum/browse/the-mycin-experiments). It used a simple rules-based approach to identify patterns and suggest treatment. These types of models have begun to be applied in AI neural networks in the last 5 years by companies like Tempus.

A 2019 survey of over 300,000 physicians found that "89.9% of office-based physicians used an electronic health record (EHR) system." [National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey Results and Products](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nehrs/surveyproducts.htm#:~:text=91.5%25%20of%20primary%20care%20physicians,physicians%20used%20an%20EHR%20system.) - National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey - 2019 and [Public use file national weighted estimates: National Electronic Health Records Survey, 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nehrs/2019NEHRS-PUF-weighted-estimates-508.pdf).

Because EHRs are now so prevalent, integrating datasets and analysis into those systems is a large business opportunity and is well-fit for AI.

In 2019, Thomas Davenport and Ravi Kalakota and noted data collection of test results, genetic abnormalities, DNA profiles, and treatments was not the main problem preventing doctors and patients from having better diagnostics. Rather, the problem of solving how doctors and patients get access to that data and how it is correlated is critical. As more physicians adopt EHRs, it's essential they can access both data and analysis of that information through their EHRs.

> "But whether rules-based or algorithmic in nature, AI-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations are sometimes challenging to embed in clinical workflows and EHR systems. Such integration issues have probably been a greater barrier to broad implementation of AI than any inability to provide accurate and effective recommendations; and many AI-based capabilities for diagnosis and treatment from tech firms are standalone in nature or address only a single aspect of care."

### What are the other major companies in this field?
There are two types of companies investing in this field.
EHR companies, such as McKesson and Epic 
Medica data aggregators and analyzers, such as 

Here are some of the top companies in this field: 

**EHRs**
* Epic (Epic Genomics Module and Aura)
* Cerner
* CureMD
* Meditech
* NextGen
* Veradigm (formally known as, Allscripts)
* Flatiron’s OncoEMR
* iKnowMed
* McKesson

**Medical data aggregators**
* OpGen
* Genuity Science



## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
 Tempus stands out in this field for several reasons. First, public information from EHR companies show they're focused more on improving claims review and acceptance rates. This is a great thing for them to solve, but it's not my area of focus for this case study.
