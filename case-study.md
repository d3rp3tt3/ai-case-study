# Tempus AI: Using Artificial Intelligence to Create More  Targeted and Successful Patient Treatment Plans

## Overview and Origin
[Tempus AI](https://www.tempus.com/) was founded in 2015 and is pre-IPO. The company's legal name is Tempus Labs, Inc.

Eric Lefkofsky is the founder. [Eric's bio on Tempus website](https://www.tempus.com/team_members/eric-lefkofsky/). He is a co-founder and Chairman of Groupon and is a founding partner of a venture capital company named [Lightbank](https://www.lightbank.com/team-portfolio/eric-lefkofsky). 

Eric Lefkofsky has said he started the company because his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. He wanted to use data to inform patient diagnoses and treatment to improve patients' overall recovery.

Tempus has 16 investors, 5 of which are lead investors. They've raised $1.3 billion over 13 rounds of funding. They are currently a series G company and have had two rounds of debt financing. [Tempus financial data on Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tempus-3/company_financials).

Tempus plans to IPO in 2024, seeking a $6.1 billion valuation to make the company public via the NASDAQ public stock exchange.

## Business Activities

### What Tempus Does
Tempus is focused on collecting large datasets of medical diagnostics and clinical research findings to clinicians and researchers. They make this data available via web applications and API-integrations with other tools, including EHRs. 

Tempus is also working to integrate AI into their technology stack, focusing on providing analysis, pattern matching, and predictive treatment and recovery plans for patients.


### Target Customers and Total Addressible Market
Tempus' customers are researchers, clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and orgnaizations building EHRs.

I was unable to find definitive information about the market size for these sets of customers. That said, the target market is extensive and spans the healthcare domain.

* Universities
* Physician specialists, such as oncologists
* EHR companies, whose customers are typically private physician offices and hospitals
* Medical researchers

### Unique Capabilities in the Tempus Portfolio
Tempus provides both a set of tools and means to directly access and analyze their large aggregated dataset and direct integration to several EHRs. Their unfair advantage is compounded by their time in the industry, strong backing by investors, and rapid revenue growth in the last year (up 65%). The company's impending IPO has provided additional market and public visibility for their technology and strategic AI messaging. 

### How Tempus Uses AI
Tempus has documented their AI approaches at a high-level on their website through case studies. AI is integrated into several of their products. [Our Technology - Tempus website](https://www.tempus.com/about-us/tempus-tech/)

* One - A clinical AI assistant leveraging generative AI and machine learning to retrieve patient information and give realtime updates on new clinical trial results.
* Pixel - Image analysis by AI, using machine learning to assist with faster and more accurate reviews of patients' diagnostic imaging, such as CT scans, MRIs, and X-rays.
* Next - Aggregation and analysis of individual patient and larger population trends and treatment plans.

In a case study posted on the Tempus website, they highlight how the John Brancaccio St. Francis Hospital and Heart Center in New York was able to use Tempus Next to glean patient health insights from large sets of data. 

> The [Tempus Next] platform is customizable, allowing the user to filter out any information they don’t need and focus on
the exact targets of their searches. It also learns from its users as time goes on, remembering the details of
previous searches to improve the customization process. As a result, referring clinicians learned to trust the
platform’s discoveries and saw it as a helpful quality initiative. [Identifying patients with Valvular Heart Disease: A partnership between St.Francis and Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/resources/content/case-studies/identifying-patients-with-valvular-heart-disease-a-partnership-between-st-francis-and-tempus/?aliId=eyJpIjoiRjVaaE5RcHNXMzk2RVExYyIsInQiOiJuU3hLOHlTY2lBNDJDbWdaV1J1RXdnPT0ifQ%253D%253D)

The Tempus Next product uses natural language processing and machine learning to anaylyze physicians' searches and  interactions in the web application. It then uses multimodal patient data and data from clinical trials and established clinical guidelines to suggests potential treatment plans for a specific patient.


## Landscape
### How Tempus Fits into the Field of Health Data and Medical Diagnostics
Tempus is a medical data and diagnostics company, primarily focused on oncology and cancer diagnosis and treatment. They provide access to large datasets and analysis for that data to clinicians and research organizations.

### Innovations in the Medical Diagnostics Field
In the last 10 years, the industry has begun to move toward providing better aggregation of various datasets to help inform more efficient and accurate patient treatment of conditions like cancer. MYCIN, likely the first system designed to evaluate public health data, was created at Stanford University in the laste 1970s to improve treatment for infectious diseases.[The MYCIN Experiments - Stanford University](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/feigenbaum/browse/the-mycin-experiments). It used a simple rules-based approach to identify patterns and suggest treatment. These types of models have begun to be applied in AI neural networks in the last 5 years by companies like Tempus.

A 2019 survey of over 300,000 physicians found that "89.9% of office-based physicians used an electronic health record (EHR) system." [National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey Results and Products](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nehrs/surveyproducts.htm#:~:text=91.5%25%20of%20primary%20care%20physicians,physicians%20used%20an%20EHR%20system.) - National Electronic Health Survey Records Survey - 2019 and [Public use file national weighted estimates: National Electronic Health Records Survey, 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nehrs/2019NEHRS-PUF-weighted-estimates-508.pdf).

Because EHRs are now so prevalent, integrating datasets and analysis into those systems is a large business opportunity and is well-fit for AI.

In 2019, Thomas Davenport and Ravi Kalakota and noted data collection of test results, genetic abnormalities, DNA profiles, and treatments was not the main problem preventing doctors and patients from having better diagnostics. Rather, the problem of solving how doctors and patients get access to that data and how it is correlated is critical. As more physicians adopt EHRs, it's essential they can access both data and analysis of that information through their EHRs.

> "But whether rules-based or algorithmic in nature, AI-based diagnosis and treatment recommendations are sometimes challenging to embed in clinical workflows and EHR systems. Such integration issues have probably been a greater barrier to broad implementation of AI than any inability to provide accurate and effective recommendations; and many AI-based capabilities for diagnosis and treatment from tech firms are standalone in nature or address only a single aspect of care." [The potential for artificial intelligence in healthcare, NIH June 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6616181/#CIT0008)


### What are the other major companies in this field?
There are two types of companies investing in this field.
EHR companies, such as McKesson and Epic 
Medica data aggregators and analyzers, such as 

Here are some of the top companies in this field: 

**EHRs**
* Epic (Epic Genomics Module and Aura)
* Cerner
* CureMD
* Meditech
* NextGen
* Veradigm (formally known as, Allscripts)
* Flatiron’s OncoEMR
* iKnowMed
* McKesson

**Medical data aggregators**
* OpGen
* Genuity Science

## Results

### How Tempus is Performing in the Market
Tempus is not a public company yet and has provided minimal information about the breadth of their products' adoption in the provider and life sciences areas. 

As it prepares for an IPO in 2024, Tempus has had to give more transparency into their financials and business processes. These records show they had a net loss of $289.8 million in 2023, which was roughly $70 million more than their net loss in 2022. However, their revenue continues to grow, increasing by 65.8% in 2023.

### What Makes Tempus Unique in the Market
Tempus is one of the few companies providing analysis and proactive for large populations and across many types of clinical areas of focus. Their competitor OpGen, for instance, focuses on infectius diseases. OpGen is listed on Nasdaq [OpGen Stock Quote Chart](https://ir.opgen.com/stock-information/stock-quote-chart). Their public financials show their stock has been flat for several years now. As of June 13, 2024, their stock is trading at $2.45. Their is up roughly 48% year-over-year, which was achieved by cutting their operational costs by 45%. At the same time, their net income was down almost 62%. 

Tempus aims to offer their shares at $() at their IPO in 2024. If their stock performs well over 6 months, it could indicate that a more general and broad approach to aggregating and analyzing essential health data is more successful than very targeted solutions, such as those provided by OpGen (infections diseases) and Genuity (inflammatory and cardio vasular diseases).

## Recommendations
I recommend Tempus improve its external marketing materials on their website to make it much easier for people to see demos of their products. You have to share your personal information click through several pages to get to case studies today, for instance. And these case studies are not showing the product - they're sharing results. Results matter, but video demos go a long way to help potential customers and investors understand if Tempus is a good fit for them. 

Tempus should also include clear information on their website about how their EHR integrations work and which features are available in the EHR from their other products.

For new capabilities, Tempus should add natural language processing and machine learning features to its Next product for patients. These capabilities should be integrated into EHRs, enabling a patient to quickly search across their health records, get clear explanations of what test results mean and potential health conditions, and give them actionable treatment next steps, such as behavioral changes. For example, "Based on your health data, you could reduce your risk of heart attack by 50% if you add 15 minutes of walking per day into your daily routine."

Patients want direct access to their health profiles. Companies like Tempus have a unique opportunity to help physicians make more actionable treatment plans based on AI and to foster their patients to feel more in control of those plans.
