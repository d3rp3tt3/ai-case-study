# AI Case Study Research and Data
This file outlines the research I conducted for identifying trends and key companies working in improving how we best support patients, by using AI as a tool.

## Potential Companies
I'd like to focus on companies working to improve the basic low-hanging fruit: analysis of existing patient clinical records to improve patient care.

Here are some companies working in that area. 
* [Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/) - Website tagline: "AI-enabled
precision medicine
Bringing the power of data and artificial intelligence to healthcare"
    * "The company was founded in 2015, about a year after Lefkofsky's wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Tempus sells genomics diagnostics tests across oncology and other areas, including neuropsychiatry, radiology, and cardiology to clinicians and hospital systems." - [SoftBank-backed Tempus AI seeks up to $6.1 bln valuation in US IPO](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/tempus-ai-seeks-up-61-bln-valuation-us-ipo-2024-06-05/) - Reuters
    * [Billionaire Groupon founder Eric Lefkofsky is back with another IPO: AI health tech Tempus](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/30/billionaire-groupon-founder-lefkofsky-is-back-with-another-ipo-ai-healthtech-tempus/) - TechCrunch, May 30, 2024
    * [Tempus AI Overview](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/164234-62#:~:text=Who%20are%20Tempus%20AI's%20competitors?%20Genuity%20Science%2C,of%20the%2043%20competitors%20of%20Tempus%20AI.), PitchBook, June 2024
    * The area I am most interested in - how their analysis integrates with clinicial tools, typically referred to as Electronic Health Record systems (EHR). These are digital systems that provide portals for doctors to enter medical notes during appointments and surfacing information about a patient's medical records and testing in a web portal - [EHR Integration](https://www.tempus.com/oncology/ehr-integration/) - Tempus AI website, June 2024 and [Electronic health record
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) - Wikipedia, 2024
* [Genuity Science](https://genuitysci.com/]) - Website tagline: "Accelerating Discovery in CNS, Cardiometabolic and Inflammatory Disease"
  * They're primarily focused, according to their website, on using genomic data from large patient populations to identify and target drugs for conditions
* [OpGen](https://www.opgen.com/) - Website tagline: "Cutting edge infectious disease molecular diagnostics to improve patient care." AMR = Antimicrobial Resistance
  * OpGen was listed as a competitor of Tempus', but their website doesn't give enough information about whether they have or plan to invest in AI. 
  * They compete with Tempus on basic diagnistic analysis and tooling for clinicians. 
  * They recently a notice from NASDAQ that they are in violation of rule 5250(c)(1) due to the Company not filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 [Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q](https://ir.opgen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opgen-receives-expected-nasdaq-notice-regarding-delayed-form-10) - May 24, 2024, OpGen website

## Selected Company and Rationale
[Tempus](https://www.tempus.com/). I selected Tempus because:
* High valuation and dedicated investors. Companies regularly go through valuation audits, conducted by third-parties. These typically occur when a private company wants to open a new seed round (commonly referred to as a "series") or when they plan to list their shares with public trading company, such as NASDAQ.
* Lack of obvious competitors in this space.
* Clear focus of taking their existing data-focused product and integrating AI into EHRs
* Support for integrating with multiple EHRs

It's likely that EHRs are investing in AI themselves. For instance, McKesson has. However, I think Tempus' approach of providing integration with EHRs is a sound business decision. While clinicians currently rarely transition EHRs, relying on a specific tool to integrate data from many data sources (some of which could be competitors) could be problematic. Allowing clinicians to have access to all datasets and the ability to continue using the same backend tooling regardless of their EHR makes a lot of sense.

McKesson is currently focused on improving claims review and acceptance rates. This is a great thing for them to solve, but it's not my area of focus for this case study.

As of June 2024, Tempus integrates with the following EHRs:
* Epic (including Epic Genomics Module and Aura)
* Cerner
* CureMD
* Meditech
* NextGen
* Veradigm (formally known as, Allscripts)
* Flatironâ€™s OncoEMR
* iKnowMed
